# EEG-Source-Localization
In this repository, source localization algorithms such as MNE, WMNE, LORETA, and sLORETA were implemented.
- First, the forward problem was solved using spherical models and berg parameters. 
- A non-seizure epileptic activity was assigned to an arbitrary deep or superficial dipole in brain.
- Inverse problem was solved using MNE, WMNE, LORETA, sLORETA, and genetics algorithms. 
- The dipole which had the strongest acitivity was estimated as the main source. 
- Then we compared ROC diagrams of MNE, WMNE, LORETA, and sLORETA.
